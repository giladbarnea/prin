# 1) Git ignore handling
title1="Implement .gitignore/VCS ignore semantics"
body1="Current ignore handling is stubbed off. Implement fast, correct ignore processing (dir-level, per-root, overrides), aligned with fd/rg.
Include: directory rules, per-root .gitignore, .git/info/exclude, global excludes, precedence, and tests across FS/GH (GH may ignore local ignores).
Performance: cache and incremental evaluation."

# 2) Unified pattern matching across adapters
title2="Unify glob/regex matching across adapters"
body2="Filesystem has path-based matching; GH/Website donâ€™t interpret tokens yet.
Implement consistent glob/regex semantics across sources (segment-aware like fd), ensure display-relative matching, and add tests for FS/GH/Website.
Consider smart-case and escaping rules."

# 3) Performance/scalability for remote sources
title3="Scale remote traversal (GH/Website): perf and robustness"
body3="Optimize traversal for GitHub/Website: pagination & fewer calls, robust rate-limit/backoff (Retry-After, reset), ETag/conditional GET, bounded concurrency for listing/fetch, content-type/encoding detection, and strict timeouts.
Add stress tests and profiling."

# 4) Emptiness detection not only Python
title4="Extend emptiness detection beyond Python"
body4="Currently emptiness is Python-specific. Add language-agnostic heuristics and (optionally) per-language plugins.
Apply consistently across adapters. Include tests for common cases and ensure --include-empty correctly toggles behavior."

# 5) Binary detection improvements
title5="Improve binary detection (all adapters)"
body5="Augment byte-level NUL scan with adapter-specific hints: Content-Type on GH/Website; magic signatures where available.
Ensure consistent behavior for header-only vs body printing, and add tests for PDFs/images/archives, etc."

# 6) Symlink behavior and loop-proofing
title6="Symlink behavior: loops and explicit follow"
body6="FS ignores symlinks today. Add loop-protection tests and, optionally, a follow-symlinks mode behind a flag.
Ensure no hangs on cyclical links, and keep DFS order stable. Document behavior."
