### Test coverage conclusion

- Filesystem options now have dedicated CLI-level tests in `tests/test_options_fs.py`.
- Remaining gaps are repo-path scenarios and any repo-specific formatting/flags.

# CLI coverage: features and tests

Note: A feature counts as covered only when it is explicitly specified in the test (not just exercised via defaults), in a dedicated test.
Only `prin.main`-level tests are acceptable (Engine-level don't count).

  - many planned options remain unimplemented; by definition theyâ€™re untested: hidden, no-ignore-vcs toggle, ignore-file, glob/force-glob, size, case-sensitive/ignore-case, unrestricted combos (`-u`/`-uu`/`-uuu`), follow symlinks, max-depth, absolute-paths, line-number.
